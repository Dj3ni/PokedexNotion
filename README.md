# PokedexNotion
I followed a tutorial as a first contact with Api's

## Why with Notion?
I was part of a boardgame association and we worked a lot with Notion for..almost everything. We had the project to try and automate the content management of the website for people with no code knowledge. I was at the begining of my training program to become a web developer. I decided to follow the tutorial to have a first contact with Api's and how to pass data with Notion.
